How It Works
Sticky Navigation: The header and navbar stay at the top using position: sticky (CSS).

Smooth Scrolling: The scroll-behavior: smooth style on html makes anchor navigation smooth.

Hamburger Menu:

Using <input type="checkbox"> + <label> + CSS, clicking the hamburger toggles the menu.

The hamburger animates on open/close (cross effect).

The nav links are hidden on small screens, and show as a styled vertical dropdown when active.

Responsive: Readable, pleasant layouts for all devices. Fonts and paddings adjust on mobile.

Visuals: Modern font, color scheme, shadows, and spacing make for a professional, clean look.

No JS required - everything with semantic HTML5 and modular CSS!
